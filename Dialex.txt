Name: Asclepius ⚕️
Description:
	Asclepius involves developing a clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) 
	model to extract key biomedical entities—such as genes, proteins, symptoms, 
	and diseases—from English medical literature. Using distant supervision, 
	the model leverages existing resources to automatically label and extract 
	relevant information from large volumes of medical text. The goal is to 
	enhance the efficiency of medical literature analysis by identifying and 
	categorizing crucial entities, contributing to advancements in healthcare 
	research and knowledge management.
